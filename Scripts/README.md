1. The script: <br>
  [random_network_models.py] <br>
  contains the core code for network creation, visuzalization, and properties computation.

2. The script:<br>
  [ERgenerator.py]<br>
  creates an animation of the formation of a ER network transitioning from isolated to complete (in terms of the connection probability=connectance $p$). It also shows its corresponding weighted adjacency matrix, depicting the trasition (when having an ensemble) from Poisson ensemble to a full random matrix ensemble.

3. The script:<br>
   [RGGgenerator.py]<br>
  creates an animation of the formation of a RGG network transitioning from isolated to complete (in terms of the connectance $\alpha \equiv \frac{\langle k\rangle}{n-1}$). It also shows its corresponding weighted adjacency matrix, depicting the trasition (when having an ensemble) from Poisson ensemble to a full random matrix ensemble.

4. The script:<br>
  [dRGG.py]
  creates an instance of the directed random geometric graph of https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-072X/acace1/meta to exemplify the creation of the directed eddges.
